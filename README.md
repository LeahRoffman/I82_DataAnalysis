# I82_DataAnalysis

I created this project to replicate and explore charts displaying data on DC's restaurant industry through the end of 2024. Economic trend data has been used by research institutes and advocacy groups to support arguments both for and against the continued implementation of DC's tipped minimum wage policy, referred to as Initiative 82 or I82.

The following reports contained the charts and data of interest for my project: 

- DC Budget Council, D.C. Restaurant Industry Overview, https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25958428-2025-05-20-restaurant-industry-memo-final/
- Employment Policies Institute,  Flawed Analysis from DC’s Office of Budget Director, https://epionline.org/app/uploads/2025/06/EPI_DC-Budget-Director-Memo-Response.pdf
- NEW DATA: Initiative 82 Slashed At Least $11.8 Million in Worker Earnings, https://minimumwage.com/2025/05/new-data-initiative-82-slashed-at-least-11-8-million-in-worker-earnings/

## Issue context 

The debate around I82 has been heating up this year in DC. 

In 2022, a ballot initiative to increase the tipped minimum wage recieved 73% of the popular vote in DC, leading to the estbalishment of a formal timeline for full-service restaurants and bars to work towards paying their service workers the DC minimum wage. Service worker unions such as Unite Local 25 have been strong supporters of the policy, and the DC Budget Council released a report indicating healthy trends in the industry since implementation. However, the start of 2025 has seen an amplification of concerns from restaurant owners about bearing the costs of wage increases at a moment of broader economic instability. Recently, Mayor Muriel Bowser proposed repealing I82 completely, and the DC Council voted to put a pause on I82 implementation, halting the next planned increase from $10 to $12 and bringing the future of the policy into question.   

Since I82's implementation in May 2023, the tipped minimum wage in DC has been increased from $5.35 to $6.00, $6.00 to $8.00, and most recently $8.00 to $10.00 in July 2024. This presents a short timeframe from which to examine economic data and make conclusions about the impacts on wages and industry growth.  

But why are different organizations drawing different conclusions from the same sources -- and what trends should we deem significant from less than two years of economic data? I created this project to take a closer look at some charts being shared and to attempt to dig into the insights they offer.
